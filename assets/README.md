# SEO PROJECT

This project is designed for deep understanding of seo.

## Roadmap

• What the organization is trying to promote (service, product, content)
• Who the target market is (can be as simple as “women” or as detailed as personas)
• Brand (includes copy and messaging)
• Website structure (includes site architecture, navigational elements, and file/URL
naming conventions)
• Current site content assets (includes images, videos, PDF files, white papers, case
studies, articles)
• Ease with which the content and site structure can be modified (involves the CMS
and web development teams)
• Editorial resources and calendar for content development (what content is developed, by whom, and on what timeline)
• Competitive landscape
